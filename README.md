## Characteristics and purpose

Main goal was to code:
- an enemy that Shoots projectile at given distance to the player
- an enemy that rotates after the shot to the player 
- an enemy that chase the player if he cant shoot

All done with C++/BehaviorTree/Blackboard

C++ classes:

* [ControllerAiFollower.h/cpp -> Main class for Ai controll]
* [CharacterShooter.h/cpp - > Main class for shooter character]


With Values C++ Exposed to BP it's easy to setup AI and decide what projectile we want him to spawn
